Version Control: Git and GitHub
Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design

UI/UX Design Planning
Design Goals
Create intuitive booking flow
Maintain visual consistency
Ensure fast loading times
Prioritize mobile responsiveness
Key Features
Property search and filtering
Detailed property viewing
Secure checkout process
User authentication

1. List of Design Properties in a Mockup
✅ Color Styles
These include all the colors used in the mockup, such as:

Primary Color – The main brand color (e.g., #1A73E8 for buttons or links)

Secondary Color – Supportive color that complements the primary (e.g., #F4B400)

Accent Color – Used sparingly to draw attention (e.g., #34A853)

Background Color – For app or section backgrounds (e.g., #FFFFFF, #F8F9FA)

Text Color – For headings, body text, and muted text (e.g., #202124, #5F6368)

Border Color – Used for outlines or component separation (e.g., #E0E0E0)

Error/Success/Warning Colors – For feedback states (e.g., Red = error, Green = success)

✅ Typography
Typography includes several properties that define how text looks.

Font Family
The style or type of font used (e.g.):

Inter

Roboto

Poppins

Helvetica Neue

Arial

Font Weight
Defines the thickness of the text:

100 – Thin

300 – Light

400 – Regular (normal)

500 – Medium

600 – Semi-bold

700 – Bold

900 – Black

Font Size
Defines the size of the text, often in px, rem, or em:

Heading 1 (H1): 32px – 48px

Heading 2 (H2): 24px – 32px

Paragraph (Body): 14px – 18px

Caption/Text small: 12px

Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup
Understanding and documenting design properties is essential for several reasons:

1. Design Consistency
Helps maintain uniformity in colors, fonts, and spacing across all pages and components.

Creates a strong and recognizable brand identity.

 2. Efficient Development
Developers can implement the design faster when styles are predefined.

Reduces guesswork and miscommunication between designers and developers.

 3. Scalability
Easily reuse styles in future projects or across new components.

Makes design systems or component libraries easier to manage.

 4. Improved Collaboration
Clear style guides bridge the gap between design and development teams.

Reduces back-and-forth and enhances productivity.

5. Accessibility & UX
Good typography (size, contrast, spacing) ensures readability.

Consistent colors improve user experience and accessibility for users with visual impairments.



Primary Pages
    Page	                        Description
Property Listing View:	Grid display of available properties with filters
Listing Detailed View:	Complete property details with images and booking form
Simple Checkout View:	Streamlined payment and booking confirmation.

Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.
